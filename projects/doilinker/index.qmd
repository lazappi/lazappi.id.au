**{doilinker}** allows you to link related DOIs.
Usually this is to find the published version of a preprint (or the reverse)
 It does this by querying the [Crossref database](https://www.crossref.org/) using [**{rcrossref}**](https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref) and matching DOIs using the method described by [Cabanac, Oikonomidi and Boutron](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03900-7).
