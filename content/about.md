Hi, I'm Luke. 

Previously trained as a chemist I'm now a PhD student in the
[Oshlack lab](http://oshlacklab.com/) at the
[Murdoch Childrens Research Institute](https://www.mcri.edu.au/) in Melbourne,
Australia. 

My work focuses on methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data but I am
also interested in open science, teaching and training, data visualisation and
design and occasionally photography.  

I started this blog to practice writing about all those things, science,
studying and life in general.

Enjoy!
