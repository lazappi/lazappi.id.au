<p>A few weeks ago I did a short <a href="../../post/2020-04-29-bioconductor-3-11-wrap-up" title="Bioconductor 3.11 wrap up">wrap up</a> of the latest
<a href="https://bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_11_release/" title="Bioc 3.11 news">Bioconductor 3.11 release</a>. The <a href="../../post/2018-05-04-bioconductor-3-7-wrap-up" title="Bioconductor 3.7 wrap up">last time I did that</a>
(for the 3.7 release in 2018) I <a href="../../post/2018-05-20-exploring-the-sce-verse" title="Exploring the SCE-verse">followed it up with a post</a> looking
at packages which depend on the
<a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment/" title="SingleCellExperiment package"><strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong></a> package. A lot has changed
in the scRNA-seq world over the last two years and we have grown from around
200 analysis tools to <a href="https://www.scrna-tools.org" title="scRNA-tools analysis page">almost 650</a>. Given that growth I thought it
would be good to repeat that analysis and see what the SCE-verse looks like in
2020.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;BiocPkgTools&quot;)
library(&quot;tidygraph&quot;)

<div id="getting-package-network" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting package network</h1>
<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocPkgTools/" title="BiocPkgTools"><strong>{BiocPkgTools}</strong></a> is now a fully-fledged Bioconductor package
and has some new functionst that make it easy to get information about the
packages connected to <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get Bioconductor package information
bioc_pkgs &lt;- biocPkgList()
# Get Bioconductor dependencies
all_bioc_deps &lt;- buildPkgDependencyDataFrame()
# Select reverse dependencies for SingleCellExperiment
bioc_revdeps  &lt;- filter(all_bioc_deps, dependency == &quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;)
# Select dependencies of the reverse dependencies
bioc_edges &lt;- bioc_revdeps %&gt;%
    bind_rows(
        filter(all_bioc_deps, Package %in% bioc_revdeps$Package)
    )</code></pre>
<p>The information from <strong>{BiocPkgTools}</strong> includes CRAN packages that are
dependencies of Bioconductor packages but doesn’t include any CRAN packages that
depend on <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong>. To get those we will use a tidier version
of the function in the previous blog post. This function just uses <strong>{purr}</strong>
to loop over the different types of dependencies and calls the
<code>tools::package_dependencies()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_cran_deps &lt;- function(pkgs, db, reverse = FALSE,
                          types = c(&quot;Depends&quot;, &quot;Imports&quot;, &quot;Suggests&quot;)) {

    deps &lt;- purrr::map_dfr(types, function(.type) {
        deps_list &lt;- tools::package_dependencies(
            pkgs, db,
            which   = .type,
            reverse = reverse
        )
        tibble(Package = pkgs, dependency = deps_list, edgetype = .type)
    }) %&gt;%
        unnest(dependency)

    if (reverse) {
        deps &lt;- dplyr::select(
                deps,
                Package = dependency,
                dependency = Package,
                edgetype
            )
    }

    return(deps)
}

db &lt;- available.packages(repos = &quot;http://cran.r-project.org&quot;)
cran_revdeps &lt;- get_cran_deps(&quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;, db, reverse = TRUE)
cran_edges &lt;- cran_revdeps %&gt;%
    bind_rows(
        get_cran_deps(cran_revdeps$Package, db)
    )</code></pre>
<p>Now we can combine the networks from Bioconductor and CRAN and create a graph
structure.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>revdeps &lt;- bioc_revdeps %&gt;%
    bind_rows(cran_revdeps) %&gt;%
    distinct() %&gt;%
    mutate(
        Repo = if_else(Package %in% bioc_pkgs$Package, &quot;Bioconductor&quot;, &quot;CRAN&quot;)
    )

nodes &lt;- revdeps %&gt;%
    select(Package, Repo) %&gt;%
    add_row(Package = &quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;, Repo = &quot;Bioconductor&quot;)

edges &lt;- bioc_edges %&gt;%
    bind_rows(cran_edges) %&gt;%
    filter(dependency %in% c(&quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;, revdeps$Package)) %&gt;%
    distinct()

graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges)</code></pre>
<p>We now have a graph that contains <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong> and the
77 packages that depend on it. We also have edges between the
reverse dependencies but have removed edges to other packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-uses-singlecellexperiment" class="section level1">
<h1>What uses <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong>?</h1>
<div id="where-are-the-packages-from" class="section level2">
<h2>Where are the packages from?</h2>
<p>Before we look at the relationships between packages let’s look at the reverse
dependencies themselves. We expect that most of the dependencies will be other
Bioconductor packages but are there any in CRAN?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(revdeps, aes(x = Repo, fill = Repo)) +
    geom_bar() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) +
    theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/repos-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There are only 2 packages
from CRAN, which are the same two we saw last time. These are
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Seurat" title="Seurat"><strong>{Seurat}</strong></a>, which contains the other major R object for scRNA-seq
data and includes functions for converting from <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong>
objects, and <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Seurat" title="clustree"><strong>{clustree}</strong></a>, my package for visualising clustering
across resolutions which includes a <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong> interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-dependency-do-they-have" class="section level2">
<h2>What dependency do they have?</h2>
<p>What about the types of dependencies?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>edges %&gt;%
    filter(dependency == &quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(x = edgetype, fill = edgetype)) +
    geom_bar() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) +
    theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/dep-types-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Most of the packages either “import” or “depend” on <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong>.
This is unsurprising given that is a core data structure. I suspect most of the
“suggests” packages work with several data structures but we would have to
check this and see.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-they-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What do they do?</h2>
<p>All packages in Bioconductor are annotated with “biocViews”. There are a set
of labels designed to show what a package can be used for. They provide a
convenient way to get a overview of what the packages in the SCE-verse do.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bioc_views &lt;- bioc_pkgs %&gt;%
    filter(Package %in% revdeps$Package) %&gt;%
    select(biocViews) %&gt;%
    unnest(biocViews) %&gt;%
    mutate(biocViews = fct_lump_n(fct_infreq(biocViews), 30))

ggplot(bioc_views, aes(x = fct_rev(biocViews))) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip() +
    ggtitle(&quot;Most common biocViews&quot;) +
    ylab(&quot;Number of packages&quot;) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/biocViews-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Many of the most common biocViews are fairly general terms but there is a set
that stands out as being specific to scRNA-seq data including “SingleCell”,
“GeneExpression”, “RNASeq” and “Transcriptomics”. Further down the list we see
terms related to specific analysis tasks (“Clustering”, “Visualization”,
“DifferentialExpression”, “DimensionReduction”, “Normalization” etc.). Many of
these are similar to the categories we came up with to group tools on
<a href="https://www.scrna-tools.org" title="scRNA-tools analysis page">scRNA-tools</a>. It would be interesting to look at the differences
in ranking but I suspect there are enough differences in how the terms are used
that it would be difficult to compare them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="relationships-between-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Relationships between packages</h1>
<p>Now that we have a bit of an overview of what packages there are let’s see how
they relate to each other. First let’s plot all the packages in our graph.
Remember that everything here depends on <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong> and we have
links between them but not dependencies to other packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(graph, layout = &quot;fr&quot;) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(colour = edgetype),
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, &#39;mm&#39;)),
                  end_cap = circle(3, &#39;mm&#39;)) +
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = Repo)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = Package, colour = Repo), repel = TRUE) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) +
    scale_edge_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) +
    theme_graph()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/graph-all-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A lot of these packages have no other dependencies in this community except for
<strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong>. While I’m sure that they are very useful they aren’t
very interesting for this analysis so let’s remove them by excluding nodes with
a single edge.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_deg2 &lt;- graph %&gt;%
    activate(nodes) %&gt;%
    mutate(Degree = igraph::degree(graph)) %&gt;%
    filter(Degree &gt;= 2)

ggraph(graph_deg2, layout = &quot;fr&quot;) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(colour = edgetype),
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, &#39;mm&#39;)),
                  end_cap = circle(3, &#39;mm&#39;)) +
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = Repo)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = Package, colour = Repo), repel = TRUE) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) +
    scale_edge_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) +
    theme_graph()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/graph-deg2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That’s better but it’s still pretty crowded. Let’s see if we can pick out the
most important nodes using a centrality measure.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_central &lt;- graph_deg2 %&gt;%
    activate(nodes) %&gt;%
    mutate(Centrality = centrality_authority()) %&gt;%
    filter(Centrality &gt; 0.1)

ggraph(graph_central, layout = &quot;fr&quot;) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(colour = edgetype),
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, &#39;mm&#39;)),
                  end_cap = circle(3, &#39;mm&#39;)) +
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = Repo)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = Package, colour = Repo), repel = TRUE) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) +
    scale_edge_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) +
    theme_graph()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/graph-central-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>No surprises there! This has picked out what are probably the most used and
influential R packages for scRNA-seq analysis. The central Bioconductor packages
of <strong>{SingleCellExperiement}</strong> (object), <strong>{scater}</strong> (quality control and
visualisation) and <strong>{scran}</strong> (normalisation and downstream analysis). They are
joined by <strong>{Seurat}</strong> which is perhaps the most complete R scRNA-seq analysis
package but is hosted on CRAN and uses it’s own object. It’s centrality to this
graph suggests that many Bioconductor packages provide some kind of support
for <strong>{Seurat}</strong> objects.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom out a little bit by relaxing the centrality threshold and see what
else we find.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_central &lt;- graph_deg2 %&gt;%
    activate(nodes) %&gt;%
    mutate(Centrality = centrality_authority()) %&gt;%
    filter(Centrality &gt; 0.05)

ggraph(graph_central, layout = &quot;fr&quot;) +
    geom_edge_fan(aes(colour = edgetype),
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)),
                  end_cap = circle(3, &quot;mm&quot;)) +
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = Repo)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = Package, colour = Repo), repel = TRUE) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) +
    scale_edge_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) +
    theme_graph()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/graph-central2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This has added a few more central packages: <strong>{iSEE}</strong> which is a Shiny app for
interacting with <strong>{SingleCellExperiment}</strong> objects, <strong>{MAST}</strong> for differential
expression testing, <strong>{zinbwave}</strong> for dimensionality reduction and integration
and <strong>{destiny}</strong> for creating diffusion maps.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It is great to see the expansion of the SCE-verse! The object has been well
taken up by the community and I think there is now a better understanding of the
value of using standard objects, both in increased interoperabilty between
packages but all time and effort saved during development. I had hoped to see
more connections between packages though. Apart from a few central packages
there aren’t that many dependencies with the SCE-verse which suggests there
could be a lot of duplicated functionality within packages. Now that we have a
common object to work with perhaps the next step forward in the development of
the ecosystem is to centralise and reuse common functions so that developers
can focus on innovative new methods? I have been fairly selective in this
analysis though so it is possible I have missed some of this which is happening
already.</p>
<p>It would (still) be good with repeat this for other major object, perhaps I will
get to that in a future post.</p>
