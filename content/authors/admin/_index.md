I am a bioinformatics postdoctoral researcher in the [Theis Lab][Theis] at the
[Helmholtz Zentrum München][HMGU] [Institute of Computational Biology][ICB] and
the [Technische Universität München][TUM]. My research focuses on the analysis
of single-cell RNA sequencing data including the development and benchmarking
of computational methods. I am also interested in how best to visualise data
more generally.

I completed my PhD in the [Oshlack Lab][Oshlack].
