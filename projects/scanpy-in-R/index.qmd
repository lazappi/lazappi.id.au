This tutorial covers how to set up a environment that lets you interact with [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from R.
This includes converting Python [AnnData objects](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to R [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) and [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) objects as well as interacting with a Python environment directly in an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document.
It demonstrates some of the functions in Scanpy but doesn't cover everything the package can do or how best to use Scanpy for your analysis.
