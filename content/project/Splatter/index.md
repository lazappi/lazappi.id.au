Splatter is a Bioconductor R package for the simulation of single-cell RNA 
sequencing count data (https://bioconductor.org/packages/splatter/). It
provides a simple interface for creating complex simulations that are 
reproducible and well-documented. Parameters can be estimated from real data and 
functions are provided for comparing real and simulated datasets.
