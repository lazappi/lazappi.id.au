A short analysis of housing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
I looked at two aspects, the cost and affordability of housing and the amount of taxation associated with it.
I was interested both in how this aspects have changed in different countries over time but also how they relate to each other.
For example it could be that countries with higher rates of housing taxation have lower housing costs (because taxation increases the cost of purchasing a house) or that that countries with higher tax rates are encouraged to increase the cost of housing in order to generate more tax revenue.
I highlighted a few countries of interest that stand out in the dataset, specifically New Zealand, Canada, Sweden and Japan.
The analysis was performed in Python with the final analysis displayed in a Quarto document.
