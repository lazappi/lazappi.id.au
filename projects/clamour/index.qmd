The **{clamour}** packages provides a template for setting up a website to display the results of analysis of Twitter hashtags, usually associated with an event such as an academic conference.
More details can be found on the project website (<https://lazappi.github.io/clamour/index.html>).
There is also an example website showing what the results look like (<https://lazappi.github.io/clamour-example/>) or you can have a look at my personal Twitter stats site (<https://lazappi.github.io/twitter-stats/>).
