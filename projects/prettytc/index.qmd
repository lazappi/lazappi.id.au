TeXcount is excellent and by far the best way to produce wordcounts of LaTeX documents but I found the output became hard to read for large documents.

prettytc is a Python script that runs TeXcount and parses the output in a way that shows more of the document structure and provides totals at each level.
It can be run from the command line and any options are passed to TeXcount.
