**tidydirectory** is a Python script for tidying directories which I wrote for automatically sorting my downloads folder.
It checks the date that files in a directory were created or last accessed and moves old files to an archive directory.
Separately, old files in the archive are deleted.

Files in the archive are organised based on a custom mapping between file extensions and categories, for example to move all `.R`, `.py` and `.sh` files to a code directory.

Available from my GitHub <https://github.com/lazappi/tidydirectory>.
