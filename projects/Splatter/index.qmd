Splatter is a Bioconductor R package for the simulation of single-cell RNA sequencing count data ([https://bioconductor.org/packages/splatter/]()).
It provides a simple interface for creating complex simulations that are reproducible and well-documented.
Parameters can be estimated from real data and functions are provided for comparing real and simulated datasets.
