  abstract = "The identification of metabolites plays an important role in
              understanding drug efficacy and safety however these compounds
              are often difficult to identify in complex mixtures. One approach
              to identify drug metabolites involves utilising differentially
              isotopically labelled drug compounds to create unique isotopic
              signals that can be detected by liquid chromatography-mass
              spectrometry (LC-MS). User-friendly, efficient, computational
              tools that allow selective detection of these signals are
              lacking. We have developed an efficient open-source software tool
              called HiTIME (High-Resolution Twin-Ion Metabolite Extraction)
              which filters twin-ion signals in LC-MS data. The intensity of
              each data point in the input is replaced by a Z-score describing
              how well the point matches an idealised twin-ion signal versus
              alternative ion signatures. Here we provide a detailed
              description of the algorithm and demonstrate its performance on
              simulated and experimental data.",
