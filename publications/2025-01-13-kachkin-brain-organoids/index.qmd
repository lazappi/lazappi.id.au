abstract: |
  Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold immense potential for modeling neurodevelopmental processes and disorders.
  However, their experimental variability and undefined organoid selection criteria for analysis hinder reproducibility.
  As part of the Bavarian ForInter consortium, we generated 72 brain organoids from distinct hPSC lines.
  We conducted a comprehensive analysis of their morphological and cellular characteristics at an early stage of their development.
  In our assessment, the Feret diameter emerged as a reliable, single parameter that characterizes brain organoid quality.
  Transcriptomic analysis further confirmed the reliability of this marker and identified a negative impact of mesenchymal cells on the abundance of organoid formation.
  High-quality organoids consistently displayed a lower mesenchymal cell presence.
  These findings offer a framework for enhancing brain organoid standardization and reproducibility, underscoring the need for morphological quality controls and the consideration of mesenchymal cell influence on organoid-based modeling.
