This Saturday I attended the first workshop run by
[Open Science Workshops](https://openscienceworkshops.github.io/) at the 
[Inspire9](http://inspire9.com/) collaborative workspace. Open Source Workshops
is a new initiative aiming to promote open source tools and techniques to the
scientific community. 

The workshop consisted of two main parts: an introduction to the basics of
Github (creating repositories, commiting, forking, merging...) and the
SageMathCloud; and a serious of talks:

* General discussion of how and why you should take an open approach to
  scientific research (Alex Ghitza, Pure Maths Lecturer,
  University of Melbourne). 
* [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) - An online platform for collaborative
  manuscript editing designed for digital publishing that can combines Latex,
  Markdown etc. with interactive visualisations, embedded IPython notebooks and
  built in citation management (Andrea Bedini, Maths and Stats, University of
  Melbourne). 
* [SciRate](https://scirate.com/) - A social media approach to rating and
  sharing the papers available in at arXiv.org (Jaiden Mispy).
* [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) - Collaborative cloud platform
  set up with particular support for IPython and Latex as well as a terminal.
  Kind of like Google docs meets a VM. 
* [NeCTAR](https://nectar.org.au/) - Cloud facility available to Australian
  researchers. Also the Genomics Virtual Laboratory set up that allows quick
  launching of a VM with Galaxy and other bioinformatics tools as well as
  IPython and RStudio (Clare Sloggett, VLSCI).
* [Software Capentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) - Bootcamps for training
  in scientific computing includiang Git (work tracking), UNIX (automation),
  Programming (modularisation) and SQL (structured data) (Scott Ritchie). 
* [eLIFE](http://elifesciences.org/) - A new open access life sciences journal
  in the UK that uses a consulative peer review process as well as their eLIFE
  Lens and oline system for viewing their papers or anything in PubMed via the
  [OA Sandbox](http://oa-sandbox.org/) (Ian Mulvany). 

A common theme running through the talks (apart from open access) was the need
to move towards 21st century tools and processes, both for collaboration and
publishing. 

Overall it was a worthwhile experience and hopefully there will be more in the
future, if you are interested in the details the 
[talks](https://github.com/silky/osw-material/tree/master/workshop-melb-2014)
and [agenda](https://github.com/OpenScienceWorkshops/osw-material/wiki/Summary-of-the-July-2014-Melbourne-Open-Science-Workshop)
are available here on Github.
