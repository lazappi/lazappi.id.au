abstract: |
  The increasing generation of population-level single-cell atlases has the potential to link sample metadata with cellular data.
  Constructing such references requires integration of heterogeneous cohorts with varying metadata.
  Here we present single-cell population level integration (scPoli), an open-world learner that incorporates generative models to learn sample and cell representations for data integration, label transfer and reference mapping.
  We applied scPoli on population-level atlases of lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the latter consisting of 7.8 million cells across 2,375 samples.
  We demonstrate that scPoli can explain sample-level biological and technical variations using sample embeddings revealing genes associated with batch effects and biological effects.
  scPoli is further applicable to single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and cross-species datasets, offering insights into chromatin accessibility and comparative genomics.
  We envision scPoli becoming an important tool for population-level single-cell data integration facilitating atlas use but also interpretation by means of multi-scale analyses.
