  The {funkyheatmap} package offers a flexible and user-friendly solution for visualising data frames containing a mixture of categorical, proportional, and text-based data.
  It simplifies the creation of informative and visually appealing heatmaps while providing extensive customization options to tailor the output.
  This tool is especially valuable in research settings for summarising and communicating complex results, such as those encountered in benchmarking studies.

  The package is available on CRAN, PyPI, and npm.
  For a showcase of examples and an overview of the different implementations, visit the project website funkyheatmap.github.io.
