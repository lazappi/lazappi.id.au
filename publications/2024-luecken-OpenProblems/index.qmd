abstract: |
  With the growing number of single-cell analysis tools, benchmarks are increasingly important to guide analysis and method development.
  However, a lack of standardisation and extensibility in current benchmarks limits their usability, longevity, and relevance to the community.
  We present Open Problems, a living, extensible, community-guided benchmarking platform including 10 current single-cell tasks that we envision will raise standards for the selection, evaluation, and development of methods in single-cell analysis.
