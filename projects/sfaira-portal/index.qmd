sfaira is a single-cell data zoo for public data sets paired with a model zoo for executable pre-trained models.
The sfaira portal is a website displaying the datasets available through sfaira with an easy-to-use interactive interface.
The interface allows users to search for datasets using metadata such as organism, tissue, cell type labels, source, assay or publication date.
sfaira portal was built using the Vue JavaScript framework.
