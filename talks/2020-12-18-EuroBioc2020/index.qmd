  Unlike traditional bulk RNA-seq analysis which is dominated by Bioconductor, packages for analysing single-cell RNA sequencing data are more fragmented.
  Currently, there are three key ecosystems, the [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) package (available from CRAN), Bioconductor's [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment/) object and the [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Python object used by the [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package.
  While these platforms each have strengths and weaknesses most analysts are likely to only use one of them.
  In this talk, I discuss how interoperability between R and Python can allow us to take advantage of these platforms strengths and avoid unnecessary reimplementation of methods.
  I highlight the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package for interacting with Python, the [basilisk](https://bioconductor.org/packages/basilisk/) package for encapsulating Python environments, my [zellkonverter](https://bioconductor.org/packages/zellkonverter/) package for converting between AnnData and SingleCellExperiment objects and the [velociraptor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/velociraptor/) package as an example of wrapping a Python package.
  The methods in the [scVelo](http://scvelo.org/) (package wrapped by velociraptor) for calculating RNA velocity and the [CellRank](http://cellrank.org/) package for estimating state transitions will also be briefly described.
