The clamour packages provides a template for setting up a website to display the
results of analysis of Twitter hashtags, usually associated with an event such
as an academic conference. More details can be found on the project website
(https://lazappi.github.io/clamour/index.html). There is also an example website
showing what the results look like (https://lazappi.github.io/clamour-example/)
or you can have a look at my personal Twitter stats site
(https://lazappi.github.io/twitter-stats/).
