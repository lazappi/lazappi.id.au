Welcome to Blogdown!
====================

I've just finished migrating this blog from Ghost to Blogdown. Ghost was great
in a lot a ways but Blogdown adds the ability to write in RMarkdown which I'm
hoping will encourage me to post more often, particularly on things that include
some code or analysis.

Thanks to everyone who has written about their experiences with Blogdown. I
didn't keep track of the resources I found useful so I can't point them out but
they definitely made the process easier.

See you around!
