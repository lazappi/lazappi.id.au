abstract: |
  Kidney organoids have potential uses in disease modelling, drug screening and regenerative medicine.
  However, novel cost-effective techniques are needed to enable scaled-up production of kidney cell types in vitro.
  We describe here a modified suspension culture method for the generation of kidney micro-organoids from human pluripotent stem cells.
  Optimisation of differentiation conditions allowed the formation of micro-organoids, each containing six to ten nephrons that were surrounded by endothelial and stromal populations.
  Single cell transcriptional profiling confirmed the presence and transcriptional equivalence of all anticipated renal cell types consistent with a previous organoid culture method.
  This suspension culture micro-organoid methodology resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in final cell yield compared with static culture, thereby representing an economical approach to the production of kidney cells for various biological applications.
