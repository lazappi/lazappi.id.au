<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>From 25 to 31 May triple j ran an event they called the
<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/the-latest/what-is-requestival-and-how-can-you-get-involved/12254122" title="What is requestival?">“Requestival”</a>. For anyone not from Australia, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/" title="triple j website">triple j</a>
is a national public radio station with a mandate to target a youth audience and
promote alternative and Australian music. For many Australians, particularly
those that grew up in regional areas, triple j is responsible for providing
their first exposure to music outside the current top 50 or golden oldies. The
idea behind the Requestival was fairly simple. To make up for the cancellation
of many music festivals due to the coronavirus triple j would hold their own
virtual festival with the twist being that every song they played would be
requested by listeners. The second twist was that they would play any request,
not just the kind of new alternative they usually play. And they did mean
anything including Beethoven, TV show themes and Taylor Swift who all got some
air time during the week.</p>
<p>I thought this would be a cool dataset to have a play around with. I’ll show
some of the highlights here but have a look at the <a href="https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/index.html" title="workflowr website"><strong>{workflowr}</strong></a>

<div id="getting-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting the data</h1>
<p>triple j has a recently played page on their website that has a live stream of
the songs they are playing. This page also has a search function that let’s you
find which song was played at a particular time. I will note that there may be
some errors in this list, there was at least one time I heard a song played
but saw something else get added to the list. To get the raw data I simply
searched for each day of the Requestival, clicked the “Show more” button until
all the songs for that day were shown and then downloaded the HTML page. It’s
probably possible to do this all programmatically but it was only a few pages
so it didn’t seem worth the effort. Thankfully the HTML was fairly simple and
neat so it was relatively easy to extract the information I wanted using
<a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/" title="rvest website"><strong>{rvest}</strong></a>. What I ended up with was a <code>tibble</code> with times, song name,
artist and release and links to Spotify, YouTube and the triple j Unearthed
website. There were 27 songs that didn’t have release information on the website
for some reason. See the <a href="https://lazappi.github.io/requestival/01-scraping.html" title="Analysis website - scraping">scraping page</a> of the analysis website for
more details of this part.</p>
<p>There was a bit more tidying I wanted to before any analysis. This was things
like converting the file names into days, converting the time strings to
<code>hms</code> objects in the correct timezone and replacing Unicode characters. The
Spotify and YouTube links included queries which it might be useful to have so
I also extracted those into new columns and created a column to indicate if a
song was from Unearthed. The final tidying step was to select songs played
between 6 am and 9 pm as these were the official hours of the Requestival.
See the details <a href="https://lazappi.github.io/requestival/02-tidying.html" title="Analysis website - tidying">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="play_times.png" /></p>
<p>After all this I ended up with a dataset with 1187 songs from 896 artists off
1049 releases.</p>
</div>
<div id="augmentation" class="section level1">
<h1>Augmentation</h1>
<p>There isn’t much analysis you can do on a simple list of songs so I wanted to
augment the data in some way. I have seen some cool analysis using information
from Spotify before so I thought that would be a good source to try. Despite the
<a href="https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/" title="spotifyr website"><strong>{spotifyr}</strong></a> package providing a nice interface to the Spotify
API this wasn’t quite as easy as I had hoped. I initially wanted to use the
queries I had extracted from the Spotify links but these weren’t in the format
that <strong>{spotifyr}</strong> needs so I had to construct them manually. I also ran into
the problem that the combination of song, artist and release was both too
specific and not specific enough. For some songs I got no results when I
searched for all this information while for other songs I got many results.
These were often duplicates due to releases with slight differences in
different countries etc. but sometimes they were unrelated songs that just
happened to have enough key words in common.</p>
<p>In the end I searched first for song, artist and release and took the first
result if there was one, if not I searched for just song and artist. The only
other constraint I had was that the album release date had to have a precision
of “day” (an exact date, not just a month/year). I found that was able rule out
some bad matches. In the end I was able to find matches for 994 songs but these
aren’t perfect. There are probably some incorrect matches and there are a few I
have seen where the song was correct but the best version wasn’t selected, for
example the match for The Mamas &amp; The Papas “California Dreamin’” had an album
date from 2020 even though the album “If You Can Believe Your Eyes And Ears”
was first released in 1966. This is the reality of working with real world data
I guess and the majority of matches should be close enough to still be useful.
See the <a href="#augmentation">augmentation page</a> if you are interested in all the
details.</p>
<p>Once I had the track ideas for these songs it was relatively simple to extract
more information about them from Spotify including the album release date,
song duration, whether it is marked as explicit and a Spotify “popularity”
score. Spotify also has more musical information about each track. There are
some basic things like whether the track is in a major key, the loudness and
tempo but also complex scores between zero and one for “valence”, “energy”,
“danceability”, “speechiness”, “acousticness” and “liveness”. See the
<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-several-audio-features/" title="Spotify audio features">Spotify page</a> for more details but basically these try to
capture the general feel of each song.</p>

<div id="analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<div id="exploration" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploration</h2>
<p>The first kind of analysis I wanted to do was some basic exploration of the
final dataset. What I did was plot a histogram or barplot of each column and
pick out the top and bottom five scoring songs. You can see all the details on
the <a href="https://lazappi.github.io/requestival/04-exploration.html" title="Analysis website - exploration">exploration page</a> but I’ll just list a few highlights here.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were 43 songs played more than once (some of these are probably errors)</li>
<li>The most played artists were BENEE, Childish Gambino, CHVRCHES, DMA’s and
The Chats with five plays each. There were 209 artists with more than one
play.</li>
<li>The most played release was “Live At The Wireless” with 32 plays. These are
songs that triple j have recorded at festivals, concerts etc. The “Like A
Version” segment from triple j also contributed nine plays.</li>
<li>312 songs (26%) of played songs are available on Unearthed.</li>
<li>Most of the songs are fairly recent but there are some older ones (and
probably a few where the dates are wrong)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="album_date.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The longest song played was “Fools Gold” by The Stone Roses at almost 10
minutes long (9:54) and the shortest was “Counting Worms” by “Knocked Loose”
at just over a minute (1:12)</li>
<li>The most popular songs played (according to Spotify) were “goosebumps” and
“HIGHEST IN THE ROOM” by Travis Scott and “WHATS POPPIN” by Jack Harlow</li>
<li>The loudest song was “Ask For The Anthem” by Ocean Grove and the quietest was
“What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes</li>
<li>The fastest song was “93 ’Til Infinity” by Souls of Mischief and the slowest
was “Soon” by Angie McMahon</li>
<li>The song with highest “valence” was “September” by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and
the lowest was “Raining Blood” by Slayer</li>
<li>The song with highest “energy” was “Raining Blood” by Slayer and the lowest
was “In Disguise” by Ashe</li>
<li>The song with highest “danceability” was “Wash &amp; Set” by Leikeli47 and the
lowest was “I Still Dream About You” by The Smith Street Band</li>
<li>The song with highest “speechiness” was “RNP” by YBN Cordae and the
lowest was “Strangers” by Tia Gostelow</li>
<li>The song with highest “acousticness” was “Punching In A Dream” by The Naked
And Famous<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the
lowest was “Go” by Pearl Jam</li>
<li>The song with highest “liveness” was “Formation” by Beyoncé<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the lowest was “Fit But
You Know It” by The Streets</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="embedding" class="section level2">
<h2>Embedding</h2>
<p>Now that I had a look at each variable individually I wanted to see what the
dataset looked like as a whole. The first thing you always do with a new
dataset is a PCA so for the songs with Spotify data I took the duration,
loudness, tempo, valence, energy, danceability, speechiness, acousticness and
liveness. The scatter plots don’t look great but the loadings are interesting.</p>
<p><img src="pca_loadings.png" /></p>
<p>For example you can see that PC1 separates loudness and enery from acousticness
and PC6 separates speeciness from valence and tempo.</p>
<p>I then did a t-SNE using these principal components. I had hoped that this
information might be enough to see some clear separation between genres or
styles but this isn’t really the case. There are few variable which are
restricted to one part of the space, for example liveness:</p>
<p><img src="tsne_liveness.png" /></p>
<p>But most of the other variables just show a general trend like loudness.</p>
<p><img src="tsne_loudness.png" /></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://lazappi.github.io/requestival/05-embedding.html" title="Analysis website - embedding">embedding page</a> if you would like to see what all the
other variables look like.</p>

</div>
<div id="outro" class="section level1">
<h1>Outro</h1>
<p>This is really only an exploratory analysis and there are lots more things you
could do: clustering to group songs, looking at correlations, text analysis etc.
I had hoped to find some of the really unusal things that were played (like
the Pokemon theme song) but I don’t think they are musically different enough
for these characteristics to pull them out. In the end I would call this project
a partial success, I didn’t find anything super interesting but I need learn
some things and it was fun to play around with. The dataset is available on
<a href="https://github.com/lazappi/requestival" title="Requesitval analysis GitHub repository">GitHub</a> and I would be interested to see if you can pull anything else
out of it. Maybe I will return to it and do something more detailed in the
future.</p>
