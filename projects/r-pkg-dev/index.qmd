[COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/) is an Australian organisation for student in bioinformatics, computational biology and related fields.
One way in which COMBINE aims to support the student community is by providing training.
I was the lead author on the materials for this workshop which covers an introduction to developing an R package and were produced using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).
The workshop was first run in Melbourne in September 2019 where I was the lead instructor.
