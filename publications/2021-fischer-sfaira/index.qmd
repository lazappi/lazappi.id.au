abstract: |
  Single-cell RNA-seq datasets are often first analyzed independently without harnessing model fits from previous studies, and are then contextualized with public data sets, requiring time-consuming data wrangling.
  We address these issues with sfaira, a single-cell data zoo for public data sets paired with a model zoo for executable pre-trained models.
  The data zoo is designed to facilitate contribution of data sets using ontologies for metadata.
  We propose an adaption of cross-entropy loss for cell type classification tailored to datasets annotated at different levels of coarseness.
  We demonstrate the utility of sfaira by training models across anatomic data partitions on 8 million cells.
