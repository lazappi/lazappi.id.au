Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when approaching a clustering analysis.
One way to approach this problem is to look at how samples move as the number of clusters increases.
The clustree package is available from CRAN (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=clustree>) and allows you to produce clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating clusterings as resolution increases.
