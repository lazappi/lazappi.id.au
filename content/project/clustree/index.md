Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when approaching a 
clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to look at how samples 
move as the number of clusters increases. The clustree package is availavble 
from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=clustree) allows you to produce 
clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating clusterings as resolution 
increases.
