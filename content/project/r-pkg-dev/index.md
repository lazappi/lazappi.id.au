[COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/) is an Australian organisation for student in
bioinformatics, computational biology and related fields. One way in which
COMBINE aims to support the student community is by providing training. I was
the lead author on the materials for this workshop which covers an introduction
to developing an R package and were produced using
[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). The workshop was first run in Melbourne in
September 2019 where I was the lead instructor.
