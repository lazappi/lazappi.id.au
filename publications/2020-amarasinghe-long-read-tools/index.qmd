abstract: |
  Long-read technologies are overcoming early limitations in accuracy and throughput, broadening their application domains in genomics.
  Dedicated analysis tools that take into account the characteristics of long-read data are thus required, but the fast pace of development of such tools can be overwhelming.
  To assist in the design and analysis of long-read sequencing projects, we review the current landscape of available tools and present an online interactive database, long-read-tools.org, to facilitate their browsing.
  We further focus on the principles of error correction, base modification detection, and long-read transcriptomics analysis and highlight the challenges that remain.
