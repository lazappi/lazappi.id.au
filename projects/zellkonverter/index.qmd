zellkonverter is a Bioconductor R package that provides methods to convert between Python [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) objects and [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment/) objects (https://bioconductor.org/packages/zellkonveter/).
These are primarily intended for use by downstream Bioconductor packages that wrap Python methods for single-cell data analysis.
It also includes functions to read and write H5AD files used for saving AnnData objects to disk.
