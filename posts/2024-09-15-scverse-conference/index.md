# Summary

This week was the first ever [scverse conference](https://scverse.org/conference2024) held in Munich from 10-12 September.
While it was based around the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) software community the conference covered more than just those core packages for single-cell analysis and included talks on a range of biological topics as well as a diverse range of workshops.
Putting together any conference is a lot of work, but particularly the first attempt for what is still a new community.
I was very impressed with what the organisers were able to put together, how smoothly everything ran and the number of attendees from around the world.
It is great to see these growing into a real community that is more than just the core maintainers from a few packages and I look forward to seeing what they do in the years ahead.
As with any effort on the work of students, the difficulty is always maintaining momentum as those people move on and everything is based to a new generation but I am hopeful they are building something that will be sustainable with support from senior academics and industry.
