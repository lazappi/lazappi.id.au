The scRNA-tools database and website (<https://www.scRNA-tools.org>) is a catalogue of software tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data.
We record details about what the tools can be used as well as where they are available and any associated publications.
This is designed to be an open resource and we welcome submissions and other contributions from the community.
